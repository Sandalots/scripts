Subject : QuickPort/Spring Release 14.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The QuickPort on the 14.0 Spring Release is now available from the library. You can get a clone from Amy.



Installation
------------
1. Make sure you have TKLIB.OBJ, TK2LIB.OBJ, SYS1LIB.OBJ, PRLIB.OBJ, IOSPASLIB.OBJ, QPLIB.OBJ, QP/PHRASE
   on both of your boot and prefix volumes.

2. Copy files: UQuickPort.OBJ, UQPortGraph.OBJ, UQPortCall.OBJ, QP/Hardware.OBJ, QP/Graf3D.OBJ,
   UQPortVT100.OBJ, UQPortSoroc.OBJ, and QPMAKE.TEXT, MAKE_QP.TEXT, LINK_QP.TEXT to your prefix volume.



Minimum program changes needed to run in the QuickPort
------------------------------------------------------
1. You must insert the following USES statement in your MAIN program.

   If you generate text output only, you insert :

       USES
        {$U UQuickPort}      UQuickPort;


    If you use QuickDraw in your program, you must insert :

        USES
          QuickDraw,                          {needed by program}
          {$U UQPortGraph} UQPortGraph;       {program has to use this if has graphic output}


    If you need to use some hardware interface functions, you must insert, in addition to the above :

        USES
          {$U QP/Hardware} Hardware,          {program has to use this in QuickPort to access Hardware unit}


    If you need to use the QuickDraw 3D, you must insert, after the uses of QuickDraw :

        USES
          {$U QP/Graf3D.OBJ} Graf3D,          {program has to use this unit to draw 3D boxes}


    If you like to use the VT100 emulator in the QuickPort, you must insert :

        USES
          {$U UQPortVT100}     UQPortVT100;


    If you like to use the Soroc emulator in the QuickPort, you must insert :

        USES
          {$U UQPortSoroc}     UQPortSoroc;



2. For graphic output programs, note that QDInit and OpenPort are no longer needed. See some program examples
   below.



Generate your tool
------------------
1. Run <qpmake (mainprogram, tool#, tool volume, ,other units used)

   e.g. QPmake(qportsample,100,slot2chan2) for text output only program,
        QPmake(QP/qdsample,75,slot2chan2,,uqportgraph) for graphic output program.

   The tool number is typically your machine serial number. For testing, you can use any number greater than
   20.

   The fourth parameter is for terminal emulator, default is the standard terminal.

   The 'other units used' can be up to four units used in your main program, seperate each unit by a comma.

   If you use more that 4 units, put a '<' in the fifth parameter, and a linklist file name in the sixth
   parameter. You must compile these units yourself. The exec file will just compile the main program and
   link with the linklist and other library files.

2. Run INSTALL program with the tool# used above. You only have to run this once.

3. If you have any problems, please let us know.



QuickPort program interface
---------------------------
If you want to take advantage of the features in the QuickPort, you can call the following procedures. These
definitions are in UQPortCall.OBJ. You have to add the uses statement as follows :

  USES
    QuickDraw,                          {needed to compile UQPortCall}
    {$U UQPortCall}  UQPortCall,        {QuickPort procedures declaration}
    {$U UQuickPort}  UQuickPort;        {or UQPortGraph, UQPortVT100, UQPortSoroc}



     PROCEDURE QPConfig (config : TQPConfigRec);
          where
            TQPConfigRec = RECORD
                     tosaveBuffer    : BOOLEAN;             {save lines in buffer, default is false}
                     passApplePeriod : BOOLEAN;             {pass apple '.' to main program, default is false}
                     showInputPanel  : BOOLEAN;             {display input panel, default is false}
                     CASE twoPanels  : BOOLEAN OF           {have both text and graphic panels, default is false}
                       TRUE : (vhs : VHSelect;              {vertical or horizontal split}
                               grPanelSize : INTEGER);      {initial width or height in pixels, if < 0, text
                                                             panel is below or right of the graph panel}
                   END;

          Note : Main program should call this before any screen i/o. You must initialize the vhs field if you
                 set twoPanels to true.

And

1. For text output only

     PROCEDURE SetupTermPara (termpara : TTermPara);
          where
            maxPosLines    = 50;                {max possible lines for any terminal emulator}
            maxPosColumns  = 132;

            Tcursorshape = (blockshape, underscoreshape, invisibleshape);

            TTermPara = RECORD
                          rowsize          : 1..maxPosLines;
                          columnsize       : 1..maxPosColumns;
                          toWraparound     : BOOLEAN;
                          keytoStopOutput  : CHAR;
                          keytoStartOutput : CHAR;
                          tmcursorShape    : Tcursorshape;
                        END;

          Set up terminal parameters from program or terminal emulator. Main program or terminal emulator
          should call this before any screen i/o.


     PROCEDURE VRead (VAR ch: CHAR; VAR keycap : Byte; VAR applekey, shiftkey, optionkey: BOOLEAN);

         Program can call this, instead of READ, to get keyboard input and control keys.
         But this call will not echo the character read, nor do any mapping.
         The keycap definition can be found in the hardware interface section in the PASCAL manual.


     PROCEDURE ClearScreen (clearkind : INTEGER);
           {clearkind definition for ClearScreen procedure}
          sclearScreen  = 1;          {clear the whole screen}
          sclearEScreen = 2;          {clear to the end of the screen}
          sclearBScreen = 3;          {clear from the beginning of the screen to the cursor position}
          sclearLine    = 4;          {clear the whole line}
          sclearELine   = 5;          {clear to end of line}
          sclearBLine   = 6;          {clear from the beginning of the line to the cursor position}


     PROCEDURE VGotoxy (x, y : INTEGER);


     PROCEDURE MoveCursor (scroll : BOOLEAN; xdistance, ydistance : INTEGER);

           Scroll is only meanful in vertical direction. xdistance, ydistance: positive means to the right or
           down.


     PROCEDURE SetTab (column : INTEGER);

          Cursor position is used if column < 0.


     PROCEDURE ClearTab (clearAll : BOOLEAN; column : INTEGER);

          Cursor position is used if column < 0.


     PROCEDURE StopInput;

          Lock keyboard from program.


     PROCEDURE StartInput;

          unlock keyboard.


     PROCEDURE ChangeCharStyle (newstyle : Style);

          Change character attributes.



2. For Graphic ouput

   There are additional mouse input routines that program should use instead of the ones in the QDSupport.

     PROCEDURE VGetMouse (VAR pt : Point);

          Same as GetMouse in QDSupport.


     FUNCTION MouseButton : BOOLEAN;

          Same as MouseButton in QDSupport.


     FUNCTION MouseEvent (VAR aMouseEvent : TMouseEvent) : BOOLEAN;

          where
            TMouseEvent = RECORD
                    mouseLoc : Point;
                    clicknum : INTEGER;                               {max 3 for triple clicks}
                    mouseDown, meShift, meApple, meOption : BOOLEAN;
                  END;

          Return a mouse event if there is one in the queue; otherwise, return false. A mouse event is a
          mouse button down, mouse click, double clicks or triple clicks. Mouse move without button
          pressed down is not a mouse event. If you get a mouseDown event, several different mouseLoc
          events may be returned in subsequent calls, and they are always ended with a mouse up event. If
          double clicks, events of down, up, down, up are returned, with the second down event's clicknum
          = 2. If triple clicks, events of down, up, down, up, down, up are returned, with the second down
          event's clicknum = 2, and third down event's clicknum = 3.  If mouseDown field is false, other
          fields are meaningless.


     PROCEDURE WaitMouseEvent (VAR aMouseEvent : TMouseEvent);

          This procedure gets a mouse event in a similar way to READ and READLN in PASCAL, ie, it will
          block the caller until there is a mouse event in the queue. Program should use this call instead
          of the above call to avoid polling and wasting CPU time. This call would also make program more
          reponsive to user events such as pulling down menus, clicking to other windows, etc. when
          program is waiting for mouse input.


     PROCEDURE WaitEvent (VAR fromKeyboard : BOOLEAN);

          This procedure is combination of READ and WaitMouseEvent. It will block the caller until there
          is either keyboard or mouse input. Program that is interested in getting both keyboard and
          mouse input should use this call instead of KEYPRESS and MouseEvent.



     PROCEDURE TrmntExceptionHandler;

          Standard terminate exception handler in the QuickPort. If you need to declare your own terminate
          exception handler, you can do it. But you must call the standard one in the QuickPort first thing
          in your own handler.



3. Hardware interface in the QuickPort

   Programs that use the hardware interface should use QP/Hardware unit in the program. This unit has the
   following interface.

       Unit Hardware;  INTRINSIC;

       Interface

          Procedure Noise (waveLength: MicroSeconds);
          Procedure Silence;
          Procedure Beep (waveLength: MicroSeconds; duration: MilliSeconds);


       { Keyboard }

          Function  Keyboard: KeybdId;
          Function  Legends: KeybdId;

          Function  KeyIsDown (key: KeyCap): Boolean;
          Procedure KeyMap (var keys: KeyCapSet);


       { Timers }

          Function  MicroTimer: MicroSeconds;
          Function  Timer: MilliSeconds;


       { Date and Time }

          Procedure DateTime (var date: DateArray);
          Procedure SetDateTime (date: DateArray);
          Procedure DateToTime (date: DateArray; var time: Seconds);


       { Time Stamp }

          Function  TimeStamp: Seconds;
          Procedure SetTimeStamp (time: Seconds);
          Procedure TimeToDate (time: Seconds; var date: DateArray);
