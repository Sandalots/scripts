        Parsed Query Format

        The parsed query is stored as an array that contains three
        types of entry (an array of variant records):

        action
                1) ops = and,<,>,<=,>=,=,<>
                2) binary or unary (no unary ops at first release)
                3) has two or one operands, which are represented by the
                   the index of their action, constant or field entry
                4) triple 0 is the root of the tree
                5) for first release the following restrictions are placed
                   on the operands of <,..,<>:

                   a) op1 is a field
                   b) op2 is a constant
                   c) op1,op2 are the following two triples


        constant
                1) contains a flddesc which describes the constant.  the
                   offset is relative to the start of the constants in
                   the query (see below).

        field
                1) contains a file number and field number within that
                   file.


        All the constants for the query are grouped together in an array
        of bytes.  These constants are aligned and packed as if they
        were one big record of asundry fields. The constant offsets
        are relative to the start of the constants in the query.

{**************************************************************************

        The query execution strategy is table driven:

        Qualifications on an access path are broken into four classes:

        onesided - access path constrained by a single inequality
                (<=, <, >=, >)

        twosided - access path constrained by two opposing inequalities
                which together form a range (e.g. 10 < x < 20)

        equals - access path constrained by equality on some prefix of
                the complete search key

        unbounded - access path is not constrained and so the whole
                access path must be scanned

        For each class one must specify a strategy for guessing the
        number of participating records.  This is done by filling in
        four parameters: abs_ios, fract_ios, abs_recs, fract_recs.
        The four parameters are used as follows:

        pages touched  := abs_ios + fract_ios * total pages in file
        records touched := abs_recs + fract_recs * total records in file

        To estimate the cost of sorting one must specify an estimate of
        the number of pages (2K) available for sorting in Run_pages and
        a table of fractions which are used in the following fashion to
        estimate the number of records filtered out of the file before
        sorting.

        1) Count the number of equality and inequality (<,>,<=,>=, but
           not <> ) field constraints, eliminating any constraints used
           to establish a scan range on the access path (i.e. onesided,
           twosided, etc.)

        2) If either count exceeds a constant, max_filtrate, then set that
           count to max_filtrate.

        3) Estimate the number of records passing filter as:

           eq_filtrate[count of equal constraints] *
           ineq_filtrate[count of inequality constraints] *
           estimated number of unfiltered records

                              diffopen

        given an open differential scan, a query (an expression tree and a
        record of constants), a sort order and a scan direction, develops
        an execution plan and sets up the differential scan so that the
        solution set of the query may be retrieved in sort order and
        modified.  if there is no query or sort order then the ntriples
        and nskeys, respectively are set to 0.  the null query selects all
        records of the data file.  the null sort order indicates that any
        sort order is acceptable:  the system will choose one.  the scan
        direction must be either prior or next.  the scan direction is
        simply an optimization.  if it is prior then lmfetch will start
        retrieving the real file records from the end of the solution set.
        if it is next then the lmfetch will start retrieving from the
        start of the solution set.  take note: if you choose scan direction
        prior (next) and you position the scan to the first (last) record,
        the entire solution set will be evaluated and inserted in the
        differential file at once.

        diffclose must be called to make permanent the changes.

        note: for the short term set the global variable set_sort to
        tretrieve if a key sort is desired or tsorted if a real sort
        is desired. in the final version, diffopen will make this
        determination.

        Input Parameters

                scanid - index of an open differential scan
                qwhichway - scan direction (prior or next)
                pexpr - (if ntriples <> 0) pts to an array of ntriples
                        triples, which give the query expression :
                        triple 0 is the root triple
                ntriples - number of triples in the query expression, if
                        0, there is no query

        the record is returned.  lmfetch skips deleted entries and
        entries for old record values.

        caller should call lmfetch immediately prior to with which

    {   There are two cases for run encoding:

        1) reversescan is false and the mapping of handles to physical
           addresses is positive.  that is, in a range as handle.high
           decreases (in steps of 1) the physical address for the cor-
           responding record decreases (in steps of 1)

        2) reverscan is true and the mapping of handles to physical
           addresses is negative.  that is, as handle.high decreases
           (in steps of 1) the physical address for the corresponding
           record increases (in steps of 1)

        This is necessary to encode runs in the case that we are scanning
        the data file is the opposite direction that the differential
        file is being scanned (due to a sort order that is the inverse of
        the primary key sort order).

        In either case, handle gives the largest handle in the range,
        while code gives the # of records - 1 in the run.  Physaddr gives
        the physical address of the largest handle. For example:

        handle : 10
        code   :  9
        physaddr : 521
        reversescan : false

        physaddrs: 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521
