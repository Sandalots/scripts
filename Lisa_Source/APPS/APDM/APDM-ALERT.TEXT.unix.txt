;
; The syntax for the time format string is:
;
;    leadingTimeString/separatorTimeString/trailing24HourTimeString/amString/pmString/12or24HourSwitch
;
; The five metacharacters '/' must all be in the format. Maximal number of characters inserted in the
; display is <= 4 . The 12-or-24-hour switch must be either '12' or '24'.
;
; If there is no leading time string in the display then the 'leadingTimeString' is
; empty (no space) and the format starts with the first '/'.
;
; Another example: If the 12-hour clock is used then the trailing 24-hour time string has to be empty
; (no space). For further examples see the next alert 110 (date string alert).
;
; Formal errors will cause Lisa to display the US time format.
;
; Now it's getting serious:
;
/://am/pm/12

;
; The date format alert defines date order, showing of leading zeroes, and the date separator.
; It it defined by
;                       dateOrderString_showZero_dateSeparator
;
; whereby the '_' stands for concatenation of the strings.
;
; As date order string are allowed 'mdy' (standing for the order month-day-year), 'dmy', or
; 'ymd'. Also the upper cases 'MDY', 'DMY', or 'YMD' are accepted.
;
; The show Zero character can be either '0', 'O', 'o', 'y', 'Y' for showing a leading zero and
; it can be ' ', 'n', 'N' for not showing.
;
; Date Separators are like '.', '/', '-', ' ', or any other character.
;
;
; EXAMPLES ( include also time formats, see previous alert No. 10 ):
